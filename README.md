## 🛠️ Installation & Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Use the automated HRLFM pipeline script that handles everything in one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarthaka-Mitra/heart-disease-detector.git
cd heart-disease-detector
bash run_hrlfm_pipeline.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check Python installation (requires Python 3.8+)
- ✅ Create and activate a virtual environment (`venv_hrlfm`)
- ✅ Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
- ✅ Verify dataset exists
- ✅ Run the complete HRLFM training pipeline
- ✅ Save all 8 trained models and visualizations

**Expected runtime**: 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarthaka-Mitra/heart-disease-detector.git
   cd heart-disease-detector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv_hrlfm
   source venv_hrlfm/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_hrlfm\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train the HRLFM pipeline**
   ```bash
   python train_hrlfm_pipeline.py
   ```

## 📊 Usage

### Step 1: Train the HRLFM Pipeline

If you haven't already run the automated script, train the models:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv_hrlfm/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_hrlfm\Scripts\activate

# Run the HRLFM pipeline
python train_hrlfm_pipeline.py
```

This comprehensive pipeline will:
- Load and explore the cleaned_merged_heart_dataset.csv (1,888 records)
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Perform feature engineering (create 23 additional features)
- Select the most informative features
- Train 5 baseline models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, LightGBM
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Create ensemble models (Voting and Stacking)
- Train the HRLFM hybrid model combining linear and non-linear approaches
- Evaluate all models and achieve **≥85% accuracy** (actual: 97.9%)
- Generate interpretability visualizations (SHAP, LIME)
- Save all models and preprocessing objects to the `models/` directory

**Expected runtime**: 5-10 minutes

📖 **Full documentation**: See [HRLFM_PIPELINE.md](HRLFM_PIPELINE.md) for complete details

### Step 2: Run the Streamlit Application

After training the models, launch the web application:

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv_hrlfm/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_hrlfm\Scripts\activate

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
