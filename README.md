## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarthaka-Mitra/heart-disease-detector.git
   cd heart-disease-detector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Usage

### 1. Train Models (Jupyter Notebook)

Run the Jupyter notebook to train models and perform analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/heart_disease_analysis.ipynb
```

The notebook will:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate and compare model performances
- Save trained models to the `models/` directory

### 2. Run the Streamlit Application

After training the models, launch the web application:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### 3. Make Predictions

1. Select a model from the sidebar
2. Enter patient information in the form
3. Click "Predict Heart Disease Risk"
4. View the prediction results and probability breakdown

## 🤖 Models

The project implements and compares three machine learning models:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Simple, interpretable linear model
   - Fast training and prediction
   - Good baseline performance

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble of decision trees
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Robust to overfitting

3. **XGBoost**
   - Gradient boosting algorithm
   - High performance
   - Advanced hyperparameter tuning

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Cross-validation scores

## 📈 Dataset

The dataset contains 303 patient records with 13 clinical features:

- **age**: Age in years
- **sex**: 0 = female, 1 = male
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0-3)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- **restecg**: Resting ECG results (0-2)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise induced angina
- **oldpeak**: ST depression
- **slope**: Slope of peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3)
- **thal**: Thalassemia (0-3)
- **target**: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease

See `data/README.md` for detailed feature descriptions.

## 🎯 Model Performance

After training, the notebook displays detailed performance metrics including:
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Feature importance plots
- Model comparison charts

The best performing model is automatically saved as `best_model.pkl`.

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes unit tests to verify functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
bash run_tests.sh

# Or run tests manually
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The tests verify:
- Dataset structure and integrity
- Model loading and functionality
- Application imports and configuration

For development testing, install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## 🐳 Docker Support

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t heart-disease-predictor .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 heart-disease-predictor

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose up
```
