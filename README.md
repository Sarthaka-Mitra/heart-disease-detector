Frankly, this project was way too weak to be kept in my resume. I do not like the aspect of ML after doing it twice, nor do i like the idea of generating an entire project only with AI slop. That's why I'm archiving this repo, I don't plan to or intend to work on this repo anymore, its a complete project, and I don't want to improve in it further, because *I* won't improve if I continue this.

I hope future me does not do any more ML slop. If he does, I sincerely hope its actually for something better for the world, and not for some measely grade points.
