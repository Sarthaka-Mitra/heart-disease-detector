## Installation & Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Use the automated HRLFM pipeline script that handles everything in one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarthaka-Mitra/heart-disease-detector.git
cd heart-disease-detector
bash run_hrlfm_pipeline.sh
```

This script will:
- Check Python installation (requires Python 3.8+)
- Create and activate a virtual environment (`venv_hrlfm`)
- Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Verify dataset exists
- Run the complete HRLFM training pipeline
- Save all 8 trained models and visualizations

**Expected runtime**: 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarthaka-Mitra/heart-disease-detector.git
   cd heart-disease-detector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv_hrlfm
   source venv_hrlfm/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_hrlfm\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train the HRLFM pipeline**
   ```bash
   python train_hrlfm_pipeline.py
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Train the HRLFM Pipeline

If you haven't already run the automated script, train the models:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv_hrlfm/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_hrlfm\Scripts\activate

# Run the HRLFM pipeline
python train_hrlfm_pipeline.py
```

This comprehensive pipeline will:
- Load and explore the cleaned_merged_heart_dataset.csv (1,888 records)
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Perform feature engineering (create 23 additional features)
- Select the most informative features
- Train 2 baseline models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Train the HRLFM hybrid model combining Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluate all models and achieve **≥85% accuracy**
- Generate interpretability visualizations (feature importance, ROC curves)
- Save all models and preprocessing objects to the `models/` directory
- Save test dataset separately for later model validation

**Expected runtime**: 5-10 minutes

**Full documentation**: See [HRLFM_PIPELINE.md](HRLFM_PIPELINE.md) for complete details

### Step 2: Run the Streamlit Application

After training the models, launch the web application:

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv_hrlfm/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_hrlfm\Scripts\activate

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step 3: Make Predictions

1. Select a model from the sidebar (3 models available)
2. Enter patient information in the form:
   - Age, sex, chest pain type
   - Blood pressure, cholesterol levels
   - ECG results, heart rate
   - Exercise-induced symptoms
   - And more clinical measurements
3. Click "Predict Heart Disease Risk"
4. View the prediction results with:
   - Disease probability breakdown
   - Risk assessment (Low/High)
   - Input summary table
5. Explore performance metrics and visualizations in other tabs

## Models

The project implements and compares **3 machine learning models**:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Simple, interpretable linear model
   - Fast training and prediction
   - Best for understanding feature relationships
   - Provides probability estimates using logistic function

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble of decision trees
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Robust to overfitting
   - Excellent at capturing non-linear relationships
   - Combines predictions from multiple trees

3. **HRLFM (High-Resolution Logistic-Forest Model)**
   - Hybrid model combining Logistic Regression and Random Forest
   - Weighted voting ensemble approach
   - Balances linear and non-linear effects
   - Provides interpretability with high performance
   - Optimized for both accuracy and explainability

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- 5-fold cross-validation

## Model Performance

### HRLFM Pipeline Results

After training with the complete pipeline on cleaned_merged_heart_dataset.csv, the models are evaluated using comprehensive metrics:

| Model | Key Metrics | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Baseline linear model | Fast, interpretable predictions with feature importance |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble approach | Robust predictions through decision tree voting |
| **HRLFM** | Hybrid ensemble | Balanced performance combining LR and RF strengths |

**Target Achieved**: All models exceed the 85% accuracy target

**Key Achievements:**
- Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- All models: >85% accuracy
- HRLFM balances performance with interpretability

The pipeline displays detailed performance metrics including:
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Feature importance plots
- Model comparison charts

The best performing model is automatically saved as `best_model.pkl`.
