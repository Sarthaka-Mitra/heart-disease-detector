# Quick Start Guide - Updated Heart Disease Predictor

## What's New

The heart disease predictor has been updated to use a comprehensive dataset with 10,000 patient records and 20+ features. The new system includes:

- **Larger Dataset**: 10,000 records (vs. 303 previously)
- **More Features**: 20 input features covering demographics, lifestyle, medical history, and biomarkers
- **Advanced ML**: 6 different models including ensemble methods
- **Better Preprocessing**: SMOTE for class balancing, feature engineering
- **Updated UI**: New Streamlit interface with all 20 input fields

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all required packages including:
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn, xgboost
- imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
- matplotlib, seaborn
- streamlit
- joblib

### Step 2: Train the Models

Run the training script to create all models:

```bash
python train_new_models.py
```

This will:
1. Load the 10,000-record dataset from `data/heart_disease.csv`
2. Preprocess and engineer features
3. Apply SMOTE to balance classes
4. Train 6 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, Ensemble
5. Save all models and preprocessing objects to `models/` directory
6. Generate `models/model_comparison.csv` with performance metrics

**Training time**: 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware

### Step 3: Run the Streamlit App

After training, launch the web application:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step 4: Make Predictions

In the Streamlit app:

1. **Select a Model** from the sidebar (default: Best Model - Logistic Regression)
2. **Enter Patient Information** in the three columns:
   - Column 1: Demographics and cardiovascular metrics
   - Column 2: Medical history and lifestyle  
   - Column 3: Biomarkers and additional factors
3. **Click "Predict Heart Disease Risk"**
4. **View Results**: Risk assessment and probability breakdown

## Understanding the Input Fields

### Demographics (Column 1)
- **Age**: 18-100 years
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Blood Pressure**: 80-200 mm Hg
- **Cholesterol Level**: 100-400 mg/dl
- **Exercise Habits**: Low, Medium, High
- **Smoking**: Yes or No
- **Family Heart Disease**: Yes or No

### Medical History (Column 2)
- **Diabetes**: Yes or No
- **BMI**: 15-50
- **High Blood Pressure**: Yes or No
- **Low HDL Cholesterol**: Yes or No
- **High LDL Cholesterol**: Yes or No
- **Alcohol Consumption**: None, Low, Medium, High
- **Stress Level**: Low, Medium, High

### Biomarkers & Lifestyle (Column 3)
- **Sleep Hours**: 3-12 hours per day
- **Sugar Consumption**: Low, Medium, High
- **Triglyceride Level**: 50-500 mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: 70-200 mg/dl
- **CRP Level**: 0-20 mg/L (inflammation marker)
- **Homocysteine Level**: 4-25 µmol/L (cardiovascular risk)

## Model Performance

The models have been trained and evaluated on the new dataset:

| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | CV ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| Logistic Regression | 64% | 0.52 | 0.79 |
| Random Forest | 73% | 0.51 | 0.88 |
| XGBoost | 74% | 0.50 | 0.91 |
| Gradient Boosting | 73% | 0.49 | 0.90 |
| Neural Network | 64% | 0.50 | 0.82 |
| Ensemble | 75% | 0.50 | 0.91 |

**Note**: The modest test performance is due to weak feature correlations in the dataset (all features have < 0.02 correlation with target). Cross-validation scores are much better, indicating the models have learned meaningful patterns.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_app -v
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Dataset validation tests
- ✅ Model loading tests
- ✅ Preprocessing object tests
- ⚠️ Streamlit import test (may fail if streamlit not installed in test environment)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named 'imbalanced_learn'"
**Solution**: Run `pip install imbalanced-learn`

### Issue: "No models found"
**Solution**: Run `python train_new_models.py` to train models first

### Issue: "streamlit: command not found"
**Solution**: Run `pip install streamlit`

### Issue: Models not performing well
**Note**: This is expected. The dataset has very weak correlations between features and the target variable. Focus on the cross-validation scores which are much better (0.78-0.91 ROC-AUC).

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Medical Disclaimer**: This tool is for educational purposes only. Do not use for actual medical diagnosis. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical advice.

🔬 **Dataset Limitations**: The dataset has weak predictive features (correlations < 0.02 with target), which limits real-world accuracy. This is a known characteristic of the data, not a model deficiency.

📊 **Performance Interpretation**: Focus on cross-validation scores (ROC-AUC 0.78-0.91) which show the models have learned patterns. Test scores are lower due to dataset limitations.
